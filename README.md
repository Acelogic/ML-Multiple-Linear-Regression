# ML-Multiple-Linear-Regression
The objective of this project was to learn the fundamentals of multiple linear regression. 

# What is Multiple Linear Regression? 
Multiple Linear Regression is a type of regression analysis that is used to study the relationship between a dependent variable (also referred to as the criterion variable) and multiple independent variables. It is an extension of simple linear regression to multiple predictors, where the dependent variable is regressed on multiple independent variables. The data for this project comes from the Ames Housing dataset. This dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock and includes information on residential houses sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.
